<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.2</span> In-depth survey</h2>
<p>Afterwards, a random adult individual is selected from the household for the in-depth interview. Within the households, we limit the potential invidivuals available for the in-depth interview to those aged 18-34, the age range were most of the irregular migrants are drawn from. For participation, respondends are given a rechargable torch as a token. We include questions on household composition (table), demographics (table) and cognitive abilities (table) before turning into the main components of the questionnaire.</p>
<div id="social-networks" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.2.1</span> Social Networks</h3>
<p>We ask individuals about their presence on social media and the size of their network. Most importantly, we ask them to identify positive and negative content about trying to migrate to Europe on their Facebook. Surveyors will snapshot the post, covering personal details (e.g. the account that shared it) for further content analysis. This section of the questionnaire is intended to asses the influence of social media in the beliefs of potential migrants, especially to understand their filtering process of information.</p>
</div>
<div id="migration" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.2.2</span> Migration</h3>
<p>We ask individuals about their own migrating activities, as well as those of family and friends. We include questions about motivations and locations. Especially, we add questions to know about family, friends as well as self past attempts to travel by routes but also about own interest in embarking in the journey by routes in the future.</p>

### Expectations about Europe
The questionnaire includes a battery of questions that seek to assess to what extend are people informed about living and working condition in Europe. This includes questions about income, welfare state, asylum and migration policies, among others. (TABLE) This section of the survey is incentivized, announcing at the begining that for each question answered that is placed in the top half of best guesses they will receive 50 Naira in mobile credit.</p>

We ask questions about experiences that people might encounter along the routes (injuries, sexual violence, etc.), the destiny of those who follow land (returned from Nigeria, reached Europe), and knowledge about the actual journey (lenghth, transportation, risks, costs). We also include questions about perceptions on those that do the travel by land.</p>
